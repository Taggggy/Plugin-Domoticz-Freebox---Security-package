# Plugin-Domoticz-Freebox---Security-package
A Domoticz plugin to get the state of every sensors in the Freebox Delta security package and to control its alarm via the Freebox remote.

Most of the work was done by Supermat, you can find his initial repository on : https://github.com/supermat/PluginDomoticzFreebox.
I added everything about the security package of the freebox, thus you can add the following things on Domoticz :

-The main freebox alarm
-The freebox remote 
-The IR motion sensor
-The freebox camera
-The door-opening sensor
